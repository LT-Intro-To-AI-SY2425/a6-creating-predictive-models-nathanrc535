# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
R squared value is around 0.626. Since the value is not close to 1 or -1, there is no linear positive or inverse relationship. 
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
The prediced systolic blood pressure is 136.5.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model? 
I think the model's predictions are only okay. I think it still needs to be way more accurate in order to predict someone's blood pressure based on age. This is because the data given in the dataset is pretty scattered and not fully definitive for a reliable line of fit. To improve the model, I think there needs to be a lot more data iven before a good prediction can be made.
